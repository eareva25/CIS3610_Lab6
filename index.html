    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
        News coverage of <a href="https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0054/4525586.pdf"> UFO in 1966 </a>
        were explained as “college student pranks, balloons, stars, or air crafts.” This explanation of the UFO
        phenomenon covered by the media did not satisfy House Republican Leader Gerald, R. Ford. Mr.Ford having
        political power was able to file a petition to get the right investigators into the matter and give the American
        people a congruent answer to the UFO sightings.

            <p>
                What Mr.Ford proposed was to have a hearing of key witnesses like personnel part of the executive branch
                and
                eye
                witnesses of the public to testify about the sightings of UFO. His goal was to bring awareness of the
                issue
                and
                shed light into the matter because the American people deserved an explanation.

                What is project blue book? The air force created a program that investigated and handled UFO reports.
                The
                air
                force hired over 100 “high caliber” non-biased scientist to investigate the UFOs reports. Many
                universities
                were
                involved in this project. The main campus involved was the University of Colorado.
